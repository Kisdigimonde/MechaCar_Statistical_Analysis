#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

(Intercept) (5.08e-08), Vehicle_length (2.60e-12), and ground_clearance (5.21e-08) are the three variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values, calculated by their p-values.

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Our non-random amount of of variance to the MPG values variables are significantly off from the significance level of 0.05. Therefore the slope is not zero.

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The R-squared value is 0.7149 or 71%, which is a good prediction amount of MPG of MechaCar prototypes.
